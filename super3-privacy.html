  <h1>Privacy Policy for SUPER3</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: December 26, 2025</p>

  <div class="description">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>SUPER3 ("we," "our," or "us") is an open-source Sega Model 3 emulator for Android (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what data the Service collects (if any), how it is used, and what third parties may receive data as a result of your use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>SUPER3 is designed to run locally on your device and does not include analytics/telemetry by default. We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contact lists</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or tracking</li>
      <li>Device identifiers for profiling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information The App May Store or Access Locally</h2>
    <p>To provide emulator functionality, SUPER3 may store and/or access the following on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emulator settings and configuration files</li>
      <li>Save states and screenshot thumbnails</li>
      <li>Folders/files you explicitly select (e.g., ROM folder, optional export/sync folder)</li>
      <li>Downloaded flyer images (if you use Flyer view)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Data used by SUPER3 is stored locally on your device (for example under <code>.../Android/data/&lt;package&gt;/files/super3/</code>). We do not operate a backend server for storing your emulator files.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>Flyer Downloads (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you use Flyer view, SUPER3 may download artwork from GitHub:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Source: <a href="https://github.com/izzy2lost/Model3flyers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/izzy2lost/Model3flyers</a></li>
      <li>Storage: Saved locally under <code>.../Android/data/&lt;package&gt;/files/super3/Flyers/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When your device connects to GitHub to download files, GitHub may receive standard network information (such as your IP address and user agent) as part of serving the request. Please review GitHub’s policies for details.</p>

    <h3>External Links</h3>
    <p>The Service may link to external sites (such as upstream projects on GitHub). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.</p>

    <h2>Permissions and File Access</h2>
    <p>SUPER3 may offer an optional export/sync workflow using Android’s Storage Access Framework. If enabled, the app only accesses the folder(s) you explicitly choose via the system file picker.</p>

    <h2>No Games Included / Copyright</h2>
    <p>SUPER3 does not include any games, ROMs, BIOS files, or copyrighted game content. You must supply your own legally obtained game ROMs. "SEGA" and all associated game names and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. SUPER3 is not affiliated with or endorsed by SEGA.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Because SUPER3 primarily stores data locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device’s security measures. We recommend keeping your device updated and secured.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page by updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact:</p>
