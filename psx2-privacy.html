  <div class="description">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>PSX2 ("we," "our," or "us") operates the PSX2 mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

      <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
      <li>Crash reports (unless explicitly enabled by user)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We May Access Locally</h3>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <h3>Cover Art Downloads</h3>
    <p>When you use the cover art download feature, the app may connect to third-party services to download game cover images. This is done anonymously and no personal information is transmitted.</p>

    <h3>External Links</h3>
    <p>Our app may contain links to external websites (such as our GitHub repository). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security measures. We recommend keeping your device updated and secured.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
