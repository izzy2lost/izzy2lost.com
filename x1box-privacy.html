  <h1>Privacy Policy for X1 BOX</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

  <div class="description">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>X1 BOX ("we," "our," or "us") is an Android application based on xemu for original Xbox emulation (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the Service collects, stores, and shares.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>X1 BOX is designed to run locally on your device. We do not intentionally collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information</li>
      <li>Contact lists</li>
      <li>Precise location data</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers for profiling</li>
      <li>Personal analytics/telemetry tied to your identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information the App May Store or Access Locally</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Emulator settings and controller mappings</li>
      <li>Game library metadata and local artwork cache</li>
      <li>Save data and app-generated files</li>
      <li>Folders/files you explicitly select through Android file picker flows</li>
      <li>User-provided Xbox system files (for emulator setup)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions and File Access</h2>
    <p>X1 BOX uses Android storage/file picker mechanisms so you can choose your own folders and files. Access is limited to files and folders you explicitly select.</p>

    <h2>Network Use and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>Optional Box Art Lookup</h3>
    <p>If you enable box-art lookup, the app may send standard network requests to retrieve artwork for your game library. Those third-party servers may receive technical request data (such as IP address and user agent) required to serve content.</p>

    <h3>External Links</h3>
    <p>The Service may include links to third-party websites (for example upstream project pages). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal data. X1 BOX does not operate a backend account system for storing your emulator files.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>App data is stored on your device. You can clear app data or uninstall the app at any time using Android system settings to remove locally stored app data, subject to your own backups.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>No Games Included / Legal Notice</h2>
    <p>X1 BOX does not include copyrighted BIOS files, game files, or game media. You must provide your own legally obtained Xbox files and games. X1 BOX is not affiliated with Microsoft.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Because X1 BOX primarily stores data locally, the security of that data depends on your device security practices. Keep your device updated and protected.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page and reflected by the "Last updated" date.</p>
